  abstract  = "Purpose -- Initial explorations in the burgeoning field of
               neuroeconomics have highlighted evidence supporting a potential
               dissociation between a fast automatic system and a slow
               deliberative controlled system. Growing research in the role of
               emotion in decision-making has attempted to draw parallels to
               the automatic system. This chapter will discuss a theoretical
               framework for understanding the role of emotion in
               decision-making and evidence supporting the underlying neural
               substrates.Design/Methodology/Approach -- This chapter applies a
               conceptual framework to understanding the role of emotion in
               decision-making, and emphasizes a distinction between expected
               and immediate emotions. Expected emotions refer to anticipated
               emotional states associated with a given decision that are never
               actually experienced. Immediate emotions, however, are
               experienced at the time of decision, and either can occur in
               response to a particular decision or merely as a result of a
               transitory fluctuation. This chapter will review research from
               the neuroeconomics literature that supports a neural
               dissociation between these two classes of emotion and also
               discuss a few interpretive caveats.Findings -- Several lines of
               research including regret, uncertainty, social decision-making,
               and moral decision-making have yielded evidence consistent with
               our formulization -- expected and immediate emotions may invoke
               dissociable neural systems.Originality/value -- This chapter
               provides a more specific conceptualization of the mediating role
               of emotions in the decision-making process, which has important
               implications for understanding the interacting neural systems
               underlying the interface between emotion and cognition -- a
               topic of immediate value to anyone investigating topics within
               the context of social-cognitive-affective-neuroscience.",

               of these subjective inferences into overt judgment and behavior.

               thinking. On the one hand, human beings are a highly successful
               species. On the other, intelligent adults are known to exhibit
               numerous errors and biases in laboratory studies of reasoning
               and decision making. There has been much debate among both
               philosophers and psychologists about the implications of such
               studies for human rationality. The authors argue that this
               debate is marked by a confusion between two distinct notions:
               (a) personal rationality (rationality1Evans and Over argue that
               people have a high degree of rationality1 but only a limited
               capacity for rationality2. The book re-interprets the
               psychological literature on reasoning and decision making,
               showing that many normative errors, by abstract standards,
               reflect the operation of processes that would normally help to
               achieve ordinary goals. Topics discussed include relevance
               effects in reasoning and decision making, the influence of prior
               beliefs on thinking, and the argument that apparently
               non-logical reasoning can reflect efficient decision making. The
               authors also discuss the problem of deductive competence -
               whether people have it, and what mechanism can account for it.As
               the book progresses, increasing emphasis is given to the
               authors' dual process theory of thinking, in which a distinction
               between tacit and explicit cognitive systems is developed. It is
               argued that much of human capacity for rationality1 is invested
               in tacit cognitive processes, which reflect both innate
               mechanisms and biologically constrained learning. However, the
               authors go on to argue that human beings also possess an
               explicit thinking system, which underlies their unique - if
               limited - capacity to be rational.",

               automatic, unconscious, and fast, the other controlled,
               conscious, and slow. In recent years there has been great
               interest in so-called dual-process theories of reasoning and
               rationality. According to dual processs theories, there are two
               distinct systems underlying human reasoning - an evolutionarily
               old system that is associative, automatic, unconscious,
               parallel, and fast, and a more recent, distinctively human
               system that is rule-based, controlled, conscious, serial, and
               slow. Within the former, processes are held to be innate and to
               use heuristics which evolved to solve specific adaptive
               problems. In the latter, processes are taken to be learned,
               flexible, and responsive to rational norms. Despite the
               attention these theories are attracting, there is still poor
               communication between dual-process theorists themselves, and the
               substantial bodies of work on dual processes in cognitive
               psychology and social psychology remain isolated from each
               other. This book brings together leading researchers on
               dual-processes to summarize the state of the art, highlight key
               issues, present different perspectives, explore implications,
               and provide a stimulus to further work. It includes new ideas

               architecture and by psychologists specialising in traditionally

               expanded to show how the theories and insights from the original
               book can translate into actions and practice, now making a real
               connection between classroom activities and learning behavior.
               This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that
               could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual
               learning. Like the original edition, this book offers exciting
               new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers
               to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to
               learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from
               non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula,
               classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn
               most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has
               significantly added to our understanding of what it means to
               know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to
               the influence of culture on what people see and absorb. How
               People Learn examines these findings and their implications for
               what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our
               children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate
               how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth
               learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and
               practices firmly entrenched in our current education system.
               Topics include: How learning actually changes the physical
               structure of the brain. How existing knowledge affects what
               people notice and how they learn. What the thought processes of
               experts tell us about how to teach. The amazing learning
               potential of infants. The relationship of classroom learning and
               everyday settings of community and workplace. Learning needs and
               opportunities for teachers. A realistic look at the role of

               between the face and emotion and provides some guidelines for
               study of this complicated but intriguing phenomenon. Some of the
               conceptual ambiguities that have hindered research and the
               methodological decisions that must be made in planning research
               on the face and emotion are discussed. How past investigators
               handled these matters is presented critically, and a set of
               standards is offered. This book is comprised of 21 chapters and
               begins with an overview of questions about how the face provides
               information about emotion, with emphasis on evidence based on
               scientific research (largely in psychology). The reader is then
               introduced to conceptual ambiguities and methodological
               decisions related to research on the face-emotion connection
               (including sampling), along with some important research
               findings. In particular, emotion categories and dimensions that
               observers can judge on the basis of facial behavior are
               analyzed, and whether such judgments can be accurate. The
               similarities and differences in facial behavior across cultures
               are also considered, along with the relative contribution of
               facial behavior and contextual information to the judgment of
               emotion. This monograph is intended primarily for students of
               psychology, anthropology, ethology, sociology, and biology, as
               well as those planning or already conducting research on the

               experience. This book, first published in 2002, examines how
               people make such judgments. The study of human judgment was
               transformed in the 1970s, when Kahneman and Tversky introduced
               their 'heuristics and biases' approach and challenged the
               dominance of strictly rational models. Their work highlighted
               the reflexive mental operations used to make complex problems

               both accurate and dangerously flawed judgments. The heuristics

              challenge this view and propose that gossip constrains
              self-serving behavior that harms the group. When people expect
              their group members to gossip and their decisions are
              identifiable, they will be concerned about group members'
              opinions, and this should lead them to contribute more resources
              to the group. When people believe their group members are
              unlikely to gossip, identifiability of decisions should have less
              impact on group opinion concerns and contributions to the group.
              Participants were led to believe that their fellow group members
              had a low or high tendency to gossip, and that their contribution
              to the group was identifiable by the group or not. Results
              confirmed our hypotheses, demonstrating that gossip is a powerful
              tool to control self-serving behavior in groups. Indeed, the
              grapevine keeps group members in line. Although mostly viewed

               researchers from psychology and neuroscience are converging on a

               potential mechanisms for the development of synchrony between
               two minds. We then consider recent neuroimaging and behavioral
               evidence for the adaptive benefits of synchrony, including
               neural efficiency and the release of a reward signal that
               promotes future social interaction. In nature, neural synchrony

               promote neural synchrony, and thus, social bonding. This

              Reputation is a key element fueling a system of indirect
              reciprocity, where cooperators establish a good reputation and
              are thus more likely to receive future benefits from third
              parties. The tendencies to monitor, spread, and manage each

              cooperation with unrelated strangers. We review research on the
              phenomenon of reputation-based cooperation in the domains of how
              people manage their reputation in response to varying cues of
              reputation, when reputation can promote cooperation, and
              individual differences in reputation management. We also propose

              be a unique form of semantics. Here, we examine this question
              against well-established findings regarding the neural basis of
              semantics, which suggest that two brain regions--left inferior
              frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex--are critical for general
              semantic knowledge. During functional magnetic resonance imaging,
              participants answered questions about their knowledge of both
              non-social and social categories. We reasoned that if stereotypes
              are a typical form of semantic knowledge, then these same regions
              should subserve the activation and retrieval of stereotypes.
              Inconsistent with this possibility, left inferior frontal gyrus
              and inferotemporal cortex were activated only during non-social
              category judgments. Instead, judgments of social categories were
              associated with regions frequently linked to social cognition,

              bilateral temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal cortex.
              Together, these results suggest that social stereotypes should be
              considered distinct from other forms of semantic knowledge, and

              outcomes. But for observers with very different visual
              sensitivities, two heads were actually worse than the better one.
              These seemingly discrepant patterns of group behavior can be

  author    = "Collaboration, Open Science",
  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION Reproducibility is a defining feature of science,
               but the extent to which it characterizes current research is
               unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of
               the status or authority of their originator but by the
               replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of
               exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings
               because of random or systematic error.RATIONALE There is concern
               about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited
               evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective
               reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of
               the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results.
               Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions
               believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding
               and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding
               with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort
               to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of
               psychological science.RESULTS We conducted replications of 100
               experimental and correlational studies published in three
               psychology journals using high-powered designs and original
               materials when available. There is no single standard for
               evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated
               reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes,
               subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis
               of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication
               effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the
               mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD =
               0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent
               of original studies had significant results (P CONCLUSION No
               single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and
               the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to
               evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these
               results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of
               replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings
               despite using materials provided by the original authors, review
               in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical
               power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover,
               correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that
               variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original
               P value) was more predictive of replication success than
               variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the
               research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors
               certainly can influence replication success, but they did not
               appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood
               because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize
               novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery
               and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise.
               However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal
               reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea
               as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies
               the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out
               paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are
               likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase
               certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation
               when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence
               for many findings in psychological research and suggests that
               there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we
               think we know.",

              Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the

              series of choices between monetary reward options that varied by

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Behavioral-economic demand curve analysis offers
              several useful measures of drug self-administration. Although
              generation of demand curves previously required multiple days,
              recent within-session procedures allow curve construction from a
              single 110-min cocaine self-administration session, making
              behavioral-economic analyses available to a broad range of
              self-administration experiments. However, a mathematical approach
              of curve fitting has not been reported for the within-session
              threshold procedure. OBJECTIVES: We review demand curve analysis
              in drug self-administration experiments and provide a
              quantitative method for fitting curves to single-session data
              that incorporates relative stability of brain drug concentration.
              METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer
              cocaine, and then tested with the threshold procedure in which
              the cocaine dose was sequentially decreased on a fixed ratio-1
              schedule. Price points (responses/mg cocaine) outside of
              relatively stable brain cocaine concentrations were removed
              before curves were fit. Curve-fit accuracy was determined by the
              degree of correlation between graphical and calculated parameters
              for cocaine consumption at low price (Q(0)) and the price at
              which maximal responding occurred (P(max)). RESULTS: Removing
              price points that occurred at relatively unstable brain cocaine
              concentrations generated precise estimates of Q(0) and resulted
              in P (max) values with significantly closer agreement with
              graphical P(max) than conventional methods. CONCLUSION: The
              exponential demand equation can be fit to single-session data
              using the threshold procedure for cocaine self-administration.
              Removing data points that occur during relatively unstable brain
              cocaine concentrations resulted in more accurate estimates of
              demand curve slope than graphical methods, permitting a more
              comprehensive analysis of drug self-administration via a
              behavioral-economic framework.",

              (e.g. in relation to other events) and, in turn, how we retrieve
              those memories later. Because we use contextual representations
              to retrieve information pertaining to our past, processes that
              alter our representations of context can enhance or diminish our
              capacity to retrieve particular memories. We designed a
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to test
              the hypothesis that people can intentionally forget previously
              experienced events by changing their mental representations of
              contextual information associated with those events. We had human

              studying the second list. We used pattern classifiers to track

              contextual change, the activation of the first-list contextual
              representation was lower following a forget instruction than a
              remember instruction. Further, the magnitude of this neural
              signature of contextual change was negatively correlated with

               typically employed by computer programmers. The advantage of
               this approach is that solutions can be generated through
               algorithms that can be implemented as computer code. Although
               computational thinking has historically been a skill that is
               exclusively taught within computer science, there has been a
               more recent movement to introduce these skills within other
               disciplines. Psychology is an excellent example of a discipline
               that would benefit from computational thinking skills because of
               the nature of questions that are typically asked within the
               discipline. However, there has not been a formal curriculum
               proposed to teach computational thinking within psychology and
               the behavioural sciences. I will argue that computational
               thinking is a fundamental skill that can easily be introduced to
               psychology students throughout their undergraduate education.
               This would provide students with the skills necessary to become
               successful researchers, and would also provide a practical and
               marketable skill to all psychology graduates.",

              belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as

              who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional

              negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important

              treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also

              accurately assess targets' emotions), extant research has failed
              to consistently demonstrate a correspondence between them. We

              (if not always thoughtful) control. However, considerable
              evidence now supports the view that social behavior often
              operates in an implicit or unconscious fashion. The identifying
              feature of implicit cognition is that past experience influences
              judgment in a fashion not introspectively known by the actor. The
              present conclusion--that attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes

               societies, and many functions have been attributed to such
               gossiping. One of these proposed functions is the management of
               reputations. Reputation by itself has been shown to have a
               strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect
               reciprocity, and this notion helps to explain the observed high
               level of cooperation in humans. Here we designed a game to test
               a widespread assumption that gossip functions as a vector for
               the transmission of social information. This empirical study
               (with 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on the
               composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and the
               behavior based on gossip information. We show that gossip has a

               direct observation) as well as gossip about the same
               information. Thus, it is evident that gossip has a strong
               manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative
               individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative
               individuals, gossip comments transmit social information

              place high subjective value on opportunities to communicate their
              thoughts and feelings to others and that doing so engages neural
              and cognitive mechanisms associated with reward. Five studies

              strongly associated with increased activation in brain regions

              neurobiological evidence suggesting a role for the right

              that they were causing the negative outcome (``negative'' belief)

              significant activation above baseline for all four conditions but

              Specifically, the RTPJ response was highest for cases of

              negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social
              network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that
              longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be
              transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ

              making. How humans evaluate others' suffering, relative to their
              own suffering, is unknown. We investigated this question by
              inviting subjects to trade off profits for themselves against
              pain experienced either by themselves or an anonymous other
              person. Subjects made choices between different amounts of money
              and different numbers of painful electric shocks. We
              independently varied the recipient of the shocks (self vs. other)
              and whether the choice involved paying to decrease pain or
              profiting by increasing pain. We built computational models to
              quantify the relative values subjects ascribed to pain for
              themselves and others in this setting. In two studies we show
              that most people valued others' pain more than their own pain.
              This was evident in a willingness to pay more to reduce others'
              pain than their own and a requirement for more compensation to
              increase others' pain relative to their own. This
              ``hyperaltruistic'' valuation of others' pain was linked to
              slower responding when making decisions that affected others,
              consistent with an engagement of deliberative processes in moral
              decision making. Subclinical psychopathic traits correlated
              negatively with aversion to pain for both self and others, in
              line with reports of aversive processing deficits in psychopathy.
              Our results provide evidence for a circumstance in which people
              care more for others than themselves. Determining the precise
              boundaries of this surprisingly prosocial disposition has
              implications for understanding human moral decision making and
              its disturbance in antisocial behavior.",

              recently developed a mathematical approach for rapidly modeling
              economic demand in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. We
              show here that economic demand, as both a spontaneous trait and

              relapse propensity, drug seeking in abstinence, and compulsive
              (punished) drug taking. These findings confirm economic demand as

              the view that excessive motivation plays an important role in
              addiction while extending the idea that drug dependence
              represents a shift from initially recreational to compulsive drug
              use. Finally, we found that economic demand for cocaine predicted
              the efficacy of a promising pharmacotherapy (oxytocin) in
              attenuating cocaine-seeking behaviors across individuals,

              prevailing view is that this abstract social semantic knowledge
              is mainly subserved by the same medial prefrontal regions that
              are considered essential for mental state attribution and
              self-reflection. Nevertheless, neurodegeneration of the anterior

              as well as general conceptual knowledge. By using functional MRI,
              we demonstrate that the anterior temporal lobe represents
              abstract social semantic knowledge in agreement with this patient
              evidence. The bilateral superior anterior temporal lobes
              (Brodmann's area 38) are selectively activated when participants
              judge the meaning relatedness of social concepts (e.g.,
              honor-brave) as compared with concepts describing general animal
              functions (e.g., nutritious-useful). Remarkably, only activity in

              prefrontal cortex, correlates with the richness of detail with
              which social concepts describe social behavior. Furthermore, this

              itself, but also recover information associated with other events
              that occurred nearby in time. The events surrounding a target
              event, and the thoughts they evoke, may be considered to
              represent a context for the target event, helping to distinguish
              that event from similar events experienced at different times.
              The ability to reinstate this contextual information during
              memory search has been considered a hallmark of episodic, or
              event-based, memory. We sought to determine whether context
              reinstatement may be observed in electrical signals recorded from
              the human brain during episodic recall. Analyzing
              electrocorticographic recordings taken as 69 neurosurgical
              patients studied and recalled lists of words, we uncovered a
              neural signature of context reinstatement. Upon recalling a

              during study of neighboring list items, with similarity
              decreasing reliably with positional distance. The degree to which
              individual patients displayed this neural signature of context
              reinstatement was correlated with their tendency to recall
              neighboring list items successively. These effects were
              particularly strong in temporal lobe recordings. Our findings

              psychology journals found that only 39\% could be unambiguously
              reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that
              the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems
              from various methodological factors, including low statistical
              power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on
              publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a
              contentious debate about the extent to which failures to
              reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual
              differences (often termed ``hidden moderators'') between the
              original research and the replication attempt. Although
              psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual
              factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely
              to influence the results of direct replications precisely because
              these studies use the same methods as those used in the original

              original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent
              to which the research topic of each study was contextually
              sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of

              after statistically adjusting for several methodological
              characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The
              association between contextual sensitivity and replication
              success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These

              state representation-valence, social impact, rationality, and
              human mind-inform participants' mental models. Study 5 used 2
              million emotion reports on the Experience Project to replicate
              both of these findings: again people reported accurate models of
              emotion transitions, and these models were informed by the same
              four conceptual dimensions. Importantly, neither these conceptual
              dimensions nor holistic similarity could fully explain
              participants' accuracy, suggesting that their mental models

              govern choices about rewards such as food, drinks and money.
              Specifically, such rewards are discounted as a function of time,
              are tradable for other rewards, and reinforce work. Behavioural
              and neurobiological evidence suggests that looking at other
              people can also be described as rewarding, but to what extent
              these economic principles apply to social orienting remains

              networks, this idea implies that cooperation should fare better
              in highly clustered networks such as cliques than in networks
              with low clustering such as random networks. To test this
              hypothesis, we conducted a series of web-based experiments, in
              which 24 individuals played a local public goods game arranged on
              one of five network topologies that varied between disconnected
              cliques and a random regular graph. In contrast with previous

              significant effect on average contributions. This result implies
              either that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else
              that cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement
              between connected neighbors. We then tested both of these

              contributing neighbors as they were to increase their
              contributions in response to high contributing neighbors. Second,

              potentially motivating our behavior. However, so far few studies
              have examined in detail how social comparison can influence
              interpersonal decision-making. One aspect of social
              decision-making that is of particular importance is cooperative

              cooperation in the provision of public goods is of vital interest

              cooperative decisions via a modified Public Goods Game (PGG).
              Findings revealed that individuals ranked highest tended to be

              represent the intentions and goals of others to optimise our
              mutual interactions. We draw on ideas from optimum control and
              game theory to provide a 'game theory of mind'. First, we
              consider the representations of goals in terms of value functions
              that are prescribed by utility or rewards. Critically, the joint
              value functions and ensuing behaviour are optimised recursively,
              under the assumption that I represent your value function, your
              representation of mine, your representation of my representation
              of yours, and so on ad infinitum. However, if we assume that the
              degree of recursion is bounded, then players need to estimate the
              opponent's degree of recursion (i.e., sophistication) to respond
              optimally. This induces a problem of inferring the opponent's
              sophistication, given behavioural exchanges. We show it is
              possible to deduce whether players make inferences about each
              other and quantify their sophistication on the basis of choices
              in sequential games. This rests on comparing generative models of
              choices with, and without, inference. Model comparison is
              demonstrated using simulated and real data from a 'stag-hunt'.
              Finally, we note that exactly the same sophisticated behaviour

  abstract = "Cognitive neuroscience research on facial expression recognition
              and face evaluation has proliferated over the past 15 years.
              Nevertheless, large questions remain unanswered. In this
              overview, we discuss the current understanding in the field, and
              describe what is known and what remains unknown. In §2, we
              describe three types of behavioural evidence that the perception
              of traits in neutral faces is related to the perception of facial
              expressions, and may rely on the same mechanisms. In §3, we
              discuss cortical systems for the perception of facial
              expressions, and argue for a partial segregation of function in
              the superior temporal sulcus and the fusiform gyrus. In §4, we
              describe the current understanding of how the brain responds to
              emotionally neutral faces. To resolve some of the inconsistencies
              in the literature, we perform a large group analysis across three
              different studies, and argue that one parsimonious explanation of
              prior findings is that faces are coded in terms of their
              typicality. In §5, we discuss how these two lines of
              research--perception of emotional expressions and face
              evaluation--could be integrated into a common, cognitive
              neuroscience framework.",

              the results of three new experiments looking at leadership and
              decision making in small and large human groups. In experiment 1,
              we find that both group size and the presence of uninformed
              individuals can affect the speed with which small human groups
              (eight people) decide between two opposing directional
              preferences and the likelihood of the group splitting. In
              experiment 2, we show that the spatial positioning of informed
              individuals within small human groups (10 people) can affect the
              speed and accuracy of group motion. We find that having a mixture
              of leaders positioned in the centre and on the edge of a group
              increases the speed and accuracy with which the group reaches
              their target. In experiment 3, we use large human crowds (100 and
              200 people) to demonstrate that the trends observed from earlier
              work using small human groups can be applied to larger crowds. We
              find that only a small minority of informed individuals is needed
              to guide a large uninformed group. These studies build upon
              important theoretical and empirical work on leadership and

              habitats, many of which are our own creation. Research on the

              such peculiar animals, and how they have been generated by
              evolutionary processes. New research in this field looks deeper
              into the evolutionary history of human cognition, and adopts a
              more multi-disciplinary approach than earlier 'Evolutionary
              Psychology'. It is informed by comparisons between humans and a
              range of primate and non-primate species, and integrates findings
              from anthropology, archaeology, economics, evolutionary biology,
              neuroscience, philosophy and psychology. Using these methods,
              recent research reveals profound commonalities, as well striking

              the evolution of human cognition has been much more gradual and

              We highlight some networks of the social brain relevant to
              two-person interactions and consider the social signals between
              interacting partners that activate these networks. We make a case

              partners each know that they have the intention to communicate.
              The use of deliberate social signals can serve to increase

              with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior.
              Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the
              gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless
              investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables

              have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with
              any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and
              techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology
              become a more predictive science. We review some of the
              fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out

              characteristics that are uniquely human and those that constitute
              human nature. Denying uniquely human attributes to others
              represents them as animal-like, and denying human nature to
              others represents them as objects or automata. Cognitive

              suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced

              scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of
              whether HARKing ' s costs exceed its benefits is a complex one
              that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and
              debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as
              myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits),
              I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring

              both improve quality of life of patients and families and reduce
              healthcare costs. Despite these benefits, significant barriers
              exist in the United States to the early integration of palliative
              care in the disease trajectory of individuals with serious
              illness. AIM: To provide an overview of the barriers to more
              widespread palliative care integration in the United States.
              DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A literature review using PubMed from
              2005 to March 2015 augmented by primary data collected from 405
              hospitals included in the Center to Advance Palliative Care's
              National Palliative Care Registry for years 2012 and 2013. We use
              the World Health Organization's Public Health Strategy for
              Palliative Care as a framework for analyzing barriers to
              palliative care integration. RESULTS: We identified key barriers
              to palliative care integration across three World Health
              Organization domains: (1) education domain: lack of adequate
              education/training and perception of palliative care as
              end-of-life care; (2) implementation domain: inadequate size of
              palliative medicine-trained workforce, challenge of identifying
              patients appropriate for palliative care referral, and need for
              culture change across settings; (3) policy domain: fragmented
              healthcare system, need for greater funding for research, lack of
              adequate reimbursement for palliative care, and regulatory
              barriers. CONCLUSION: We describe the key policy and educational
              opportunities in the United States to address and potentially
              overcome the barriers to greater integration of palliative care
              into the healthcare of Americans with serious illness.",

              the consumed rewards occurred unexpectedly or were uncertain. In
              contrast, for the mOFC/VMPFC the present meta-analytic data
              suggested a rather specific function in reward consumption as
              opposed to passive anticipation. Importantly, when considering
              only coordinates that compared different reward magnitudes, the
              same parts of the vSTR and the mOFC/VMPFC showed concordant
              responses across studies, although areas of coherence were
              regionally more confined. These meta-analytic data suggest that
              the vSTR may be involved in both prediction and consumption of
              salient rewards, and may also be sensitive to different reward
              magnitudes, while the mOFC/VMPFC may rather process the magnitude
              during reward receipt. Collectively, our meta-analytic data
              conform with the notion that these two brain regions may subserve
              different roles in processing of reward magnitude.",

              instance, have identified separable cognitive or ``declarative''

              various learning tasks, and recent findings suggest that these
              systems may interact. One form of interaction between medial

              pride provide evaluative information about persons themselves. In
              addition to emotional aspects, social and self-referential
              processes play a role in self-referential emotions. Prior studies
              have rather focused on comparing self-referential and
              other-referential processes of one valence, triggered mostly by
              external stimuli. In the current study, we aimed at investigating
              the valence-specific neural correlates of shame/guilt and pride,
              evoked by the remembrance of a corresponding autobiographical
              event during functional magnetic resonance imaging. METHOD: A
              total of 25 healthy volunteers were studied. The task comprised a
              negative (shame/guilt), a positive (pride) and a neutral
              condition (expecting the distractor). Each condition was
              initiated by a simple cue, followed by the remembrance and
              finished by a distracting picture. RESULTS: Pride and shame/guilt
              conditions both activated typical emotion-processing circuits
              including the amygdala, insula and ventral striatum, as well as
              self-referential brain regions such as the bilateral dorsomedial
              prefrontal cortex. Comparing the two emotional conditions,
              emotion-processing circuits were more activated by pride than by
              shame, possibly due to either hedonic experiences or stronger
              involvement of the participants in positive self-referential
              emotions due to a self-positivity bias. However, the ventral
              striatum was similarly activated by pride and shame/guilt. In the
              whole-brain analysis, both self-referential emotion conditions
              activated medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions,
              corresponding to the self-referential aspect and the
              autobiographical evocation of the respective emotions.
              CONCLUSION: Autobiographically evoked self-referential emotions
              activated basic emotional as well as self-referential circuits.

              social relationships using functional neuroimaging. Participants
              were lead characters in a role-playing game in which they were to
              find a new home and a job through interactions with virtual
              cartoon characters. We found that a two-dimensional geometric
              model of social relationships, a ``social space'' framed by power
              and affiliation, predicted hippocampal activity. Moreover,
              participants who reported better social skills showed stronger
              covariance between hippocampal activity and ``movement'' through
              ``social space.'' The results suggest that the hippocampus is
              crucial for social cognition, and imply that beyond framing
              physical locations, the hippocampus computes a more general,
              inclusive, abstract, and multidimensional cognitive map
              consistent with its role in episodic memory.",

              lobar degeneration (FTLD): frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and
              semantic dementia (SemD). METHODS: Twenty patients with FTLD were
              classified as having FTD (N = 8) or SemD (N = 12) based on
              current clinical criteria. Both groups showed a similar spectrum
              of behavioral abnormalities, as indicated by the neuropsychiatric
              inventory. T1-weighted MRI was obtained for each patient and 20
              control subjects. The regions of focal gray matter tissue loss
              associated with both FTD and SemD, as well as those differing
              between the two groups were examined using voxel-based
              morphometry. RESULTS: Regions of significant atrophy seen in both
              groups were located in the ventromedial frontal cortex, the
              posterior orbital frontal regions bilaterally, the insula
              bilaterally, and the left anterior cingulate cortex. The FTD, but
              not the SemD, group showed atrophy in the right dorsolateral
              frontal cortex and the left premotor cortex. The SemD, but not
              the FTD, group showed tissue loss in the anterior temporal cortex
              and the amygdala/anterior hippocampal region bilaterally.
              CONCLUSIONS: Although FTD and SemD are associated with different
              overall patterns of brain atrophy, regions of gray matter tissue
              loss in the orbital frontal, insular, and anterior cingulate
              regions are present in both groups. The authors suggest that
              pathology in the areas of atrophy associated with both FTD and

              Specifically, volume-of-interest analyses indicated that when
              volunteers received $5.00 after anticipating a $5.00 win, MPFC

              processing can thus be dissected into a phase of reward

              structures have been suggested to be involved in reward
              processing. However, it is unclear whether anticipation and
              consumption are mediated by the same or different neural

              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an incentive
              delay task offering either money or social approval. In both
              conditions participants (N=28) were given a cue indicating

              to be pushed within a certain time window (adapted for individual
              reaction time). Cues triggering either monetary or social reward
              anticipation were presented sessionwise. Imaging was performed on
              a 1.5-Tesla Philips scanner in an event-related design.
              Anticipation of both reward types activated brain structures

              components of structural and functional brain image analysis.
              Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function
              to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has
              been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the
              success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of
              this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process
              in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution
              local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local
              minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to
              apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid
              global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is
              specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It
              substantially reduces the likelihood of producing
              misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The
              increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly
              used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition,
              the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of
              experiments with motion correction. These motion correction
              experiments also investigate how the results are affected by
              different cost functions and interpolation methods.",

              attribution stimuli such as Heider and Simmel animations. Left
              ATL activations to Heider and Simmel stimuli overlapped with

              psychological aspects of other people draws on a pattern of
              neural activity that differentiates social from nonsocial
              semantics. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) clearly
              plays a central role in a range of such social-cognitive tasks,
              little is known about the precise contributions made by this
              region to social semantics. The current study addressed two
              outstanding questions regarding mPFC function. First, do mPFC
              contributions to processing words that refer to psychological
              states extend to other, nonhuman targets or are they specific to
              understanding the psychological experience of conspecifics?
              Second, does the mPFC respond generally to tasks that require
              processing another person, or is its activity specific to
              understanding psychological characteristics? To address these
              questions, participants were scanned using fMRI while judging the
              applicability of words to one of two types of targets: people or
              dogs. For each target, participants made one of two types of
              semantic judgment: does this word describe a potential
              psychological state of the target or does this word refer to a
              physical part of the target? Results demonstrated that greater
              mPFC activation accompanied judgments of psychological states
              than of body parts regardless of whether the target was a person
              or a dog, indicating that mPFC contributions to social semantics
              are specific for understanding psychological states--directly
              countering recent suggestions that mPFC responds generally to any

  abstract = "Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly
              sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in
              BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear
              classification, a simple technique for decoding information about
              experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an
              array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based
              encoding model, which describes the information about the
              stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single
              voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations:
              encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses
              activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in
              practice these two operations are often confused, and their
              respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear.
              Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify
              the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that
              encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate
              some of the most common questions about how information is
              represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models
              offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding
              model can in principle provide a complete functional description
              of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only
              a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to
              derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is
              much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding
              model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by
              estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends
              by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.",

              affect self versus others, since actions with social consequences
              are hypothesized to yield greater guilty feelings due to adopting
              the perspective and subjective emotional experience of others.
              Sixteen participants were presented with brief hypothetical

              consequences to self (guilt-self) or to others (guilt-other)

              scenarios revealed distinct regions of activity correlated with
              intensity of guilt, social consequences of actions, and the
              interaction of guilt by social consequence. Guilt intensity was

              presence of conspecifics in a scene. Images of humans attract
              attention, and do so already in 9-months-old infants, showing
              that the distinction between conspecifics and other animals

              generated during mental imagery are similar to patterns of
              activity generated during perception. This finding implies that
              low-level visual features (e.g., space, spatial frequency, and
              orientation) are encoded during mental imagery. However, the
              specific hypothesis that low-level visual features are encoded
              during mental imagery is difficult to directly test using MVPC.
              The difficulty is especially acute when considering the
              representation of complex, multi-object scenes that can evoke
              multiple sources of variation that are distinct from low-level
              visual features. Therefore, we used a voxel-wise modeling and
              decoding approach to directly test the hypothesis that low-level
              visual features are encoded in activity generated during mental
              imagery of complex scenes. Using fMRI measurements of cortical
              activity evoked by viewing photographs, we constructed voxel-wise

              measured activity as subjects imagined previously memorized works

              low-level visual features encoded in this activity could pick out
              the imagined artwork from among thousands of other randomly
              selected images. We show that mental images can be accurately
              identified in this way; moreover, mental image identification
              accuracy depends upon the degree of tuning to low-level visual
              features in the voxels selected for decoding. These results
              directly confirm the hypothesis that low-level visual features
              are encoded during mental imagery of complex scenes. Our work

              working memory (the holding of information online for processing)
              and executive functions (deciding how to manipulate working
              memory and perform processing). Although many computational
              models of working memory have been developed, the mechanistic
              basis of executive function remains elusive, often amounting to a
              homunculus. This article presents an attempt to deconstruct this
              homunculus through powerful learning mechanisms that allow a
              computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both
              itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate
              manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical
              structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and amygdala, which
              together form an actor-critic architecture. The critic system
              learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and
              trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating
              mechanism for controlling working memory updating.
              Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to
              simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit

               solution-oriented approach, starting first with a practical
               problem and then asking what theories (and methods) must be
               brought to bear to solve it. Finally, I conclude with a few
               suggestions regarding the sort of problems on which progress

               climate. Public goods experiments, which are used to study this
               type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit
               will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often
               participate in several social games simultaneously, the
               interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by
               which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity,
               'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can
               sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists.
               Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and
               indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation
               for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public
               good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect
               reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public
               good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher
               profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is
               valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test

              learning is widely held to be distinct from other forms of
              learning in its mechanism and neural implementation; it is often
              assumed to compete with simpler mechanisms, such as reward-based
              associative learning, to drive behaviour. Recently, neural
              signals have been observed during social exchange reminiscent of
              signals seen in studies of associative learning. Here we
              demonstrate that social information may be acquired using the
              same associative processes assumed to underlie reward-based
              learning. We find that key computational variables for learning
              in the social and reward domains are processed in a similar
              fashion, but in parallel neural processing streams. Two
              neighbouring divisions of the anterior cingulate cortex were
              central to learning about social and reward-based information,
              and for determining the extent to which each source of

              the information learnt using these parallel streams was combined

              patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic

              involves direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same

              cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process
              framework. We ask whether people are predisposed towards
              selfishness, behaving cooperatively only through active
              self-control; or whether they are intuitively cooperative, with
              reflection and prospective reasoning favouring 'rational'
              self-interest. To investigate this issue, we perform ten studies
              using economic games. We find that across a range of experimental
              designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more
              cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly
              increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and
              forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally,
              an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions
              increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes
              greater reflection. To explain these results, we propose that
              cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are
              developed in daily life where cooperation is typically
              advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this

              pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and

              realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and

              self-restraint? Or is spontaneous prosociality reined in by
              calculating self-interest? Here we present a theory of why (and
              for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation is typically
              advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of
              generalized cooperative intuitions. Deliberation, by contrast,
              adjusts behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation.
              Thus, in one-shot anonymous interactions where selfishness is
              optimal, intuitive responses tend to be more cooperative than
              deliberative responses. We test this 'social heuristics
              hypothesis' by aggregating across every cooperation experiment
              using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period (15
              studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time
              pressure experiment. Doing so demonstrates a positive average
              effect of time pressure on cooperation. We also find substantial

              Francisco General Hospital, from July 1987 through June 1988.
              Among 1719 patients admitted to the two intensive care units,
              life support was withheld from 22 (1 percent) and withdrawn from
              93 (5 percent). The reason for limiting care was poor prognosis.
              Of these 115 patients (18 of whom were considered brain-dead), 89
              died in the intensive care unit (accounting for 45 percent of all
              deaths there), and all but 1 of the remaining patients died after
              transfer from the intensive care unit. Thirteen (11 percent) had
              earlier expressed the wish that their terminal care be limited,
              but this affected care in only four cases. Only 5 of the 115
              patients made the actual decision to limit care; the others were
              incompetent at the time. Of the latter, 102 had families who
              participated in the decision; family members of the other 8
              incompetent patients could not be found, and the decisions were

              infrequently from patients in the intensive care unit, such
              decisions precipitate about half of all deaths in the intensive
              care units of the hospitals we studied. In most of these cases

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report,
              the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment.
              Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for
              identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that
              are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been
              identified. METHODS: In four studies involving a total of 114
              participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts
              pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1,
              we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI
              activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was
              associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the
              thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary
              somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the
              periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we
              tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain
              versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed
              specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the
              same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the
              responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent
              remifentanil. RESULTS: In study 1, the neurologic signature
              showed sensitivity and specificity of 94\% or more (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful
              heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall.
              In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and
              nonpainful warmth with 93\% sensitivity and specificity (95\% CI,
              84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain
              and social pain with 85\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 76 to 94) and
              73\% specificity (95\% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95\% sensitivity
              and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two
              conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the
              signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil
              was administered. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use fMRI to
              assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future
              studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts
              clinical pain. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse

              prominence of semantic organization, the present method
              illustrates the importance of association by contiguity. This is
              done by examining conditional response probabilities in the
              output sequence. For a given item recalled, I examine the
              probability and latency that it follows an item from a nearby or
              distant input position. These conditional probabilities and
              latencies, plotted as a function of the lag between studied
              items, reveal several regularities about output order in free
              recall. First, subjects tend to recall items more often and more
              rapidly from adjacent input positions than from remote input
              positions. Second, subjects are about twice as likely to recall
              adjacent pairs in the forward than in the backward direction and
              are significantly faster in doing so. These effects are observed
              at all positions in the output sequence. The asymmetry effect is
              theoretically significant because, in cued recall, nearly
              symmetric retrieval is found at all serial positions (Kahana,
              1995; Murdock, 1962). An attempt is made to fit the search of

              perspective. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth,
              open-ended, face-to-face interviews and content analysis.
              SETTING: Toronto, Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 126

              Participants identified 5 domains of quality end-of-life care:
              receiving adequate pain and symptom management, avoiding
              inappropriate prolongation of dying, achieving a sense of
              control, relieving burden, and strengthening relationships with

              integral to the success of improving care of dying patients.
              Empirical evidence defining such factors, however, is lacking.
              OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors considered important at the
              end of life by patients, their families, physicians, and other
              care providers. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, stratified
              random national survey conducted in March-August 1999.
              PARTICIPANTS: Seriously ill patients (n = 340), recently bereaved
              family (n = 332), physicians (n = 361), and other care providers
              (nurses, social workers, chaplains, and hospice volunteers; n =
              429). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Importance of 44 attributes of
              quality at the end of life (5-point scale) and rankings of 9
              major attributes, compared in the 4 groups. RESULTS: Twenty-six
              items consistently were rated as being important (>70\%
              responding that item is important) across all 4 groups, including
              pain and symptom management, preparation for death, achieving a
              sense of completion, decisions about treatment preferences, and
              being treated as a ``whole person.'' Eight items received strong
              importance ratings from patients but less from physicians
              (P<.001), including being mentally aware, having funeral
              arrangements planned, not being a burden, helping others, and
              coming to peace with God. Ten items had broad variation within as
              well as among the 4 groups, including decisions about
              life-sustaining treatments, dying at home, and talking about the
              meaning of death. Participants ranked freedom from pain most
              important and dying at home least important among 9 major
              attributes. CONCLUSIONS: Although pain and symptom management,
              communication with one's physician, preparation for death, and
              the opportunity to achieve a sense of completion are important to
              most, other factors important to quality at the end of life

              in institutional settings compared with deaths at home.
              OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the US dying experience at home and in
              institutional settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
              Mortality follow-back survey of family members or other
              knowledgeable informants representing 1578 decedents, with a
              2-stage probability sample used to estimate end-of-life care
              outcomes for 1.97 million deaths from chronic illness in the
              United States in 2000. Informants were asked via telephone about
              the patient's experience at the last place of care at which the
              patient spent more than 48 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-
              and family-centered end-of-life care outcomes, including whether
              health care workers (1) provided the desired physical comfort and
              emotional support to the dying person, (2) supported shared
              decision making, (3) treated the dying person with respect, (4)
              attended to the emotional needs of the family, and (5) provided
              coordinated care. RESULTS: For 1059 of 1578 decedents (67.1\%),
              the last place of care was an institution. Of 519 (32.9\%)
              patients dying at home represented by this sample, 198 (38.2\%)
              did not receive nursing services; 65 (12.5\%) had home nursing
              services, and 256 (49.3\%) had home hospice services. About one
              quarter of all patients with pain or dyspnea did not receive
              adequate treatment, and one quarter reported concerns with
              physician communication. More than one third of respondents cared
              for by a home health agency, nursing home, or hospital reported
              insufficient emotional support for the patient and/or 1 or more
              concerns with family emotional support, compared with about one
              fifth of those receiving home hospice services. Nursing home
              residents were less likely than those cared for in a hospital or
              by home hospice services to always have been treated with respect
              at the end of life (68.2\% vs 79.6\% and 96.2\%, respectively).
              Family members of patients receiving hospice services were more
              satisfied with overall quality of care: 70.7\% rated care as
              ``excellent'' compared with less than 50\% of those dying in an
              institutional setting or with home health services (P<.001).
              CONCLUSIONS: Many people dying in institutions have unmet needs
              for symptom amelioration, physician communication, emotional
              support, and being treated with respect. Family members of
              decedents who received care at home with hospice services were
              more likely to report a favorable dying experience.",

              generate powerful insights into the evolution of human behavior.
              The emergence of online labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical
              Turk (AMT) allows theorists to conduct behavioral experiments
              very quickly and cheaply. The process occurs entirely over the
              computer, and the experience is quite similar to performing a set
              of computer simulations. Thus AMT opens the world of
              experimentation to evolutionary theorists. In this paper, I
              review previous work combining theory and experiments, and I
              introduce online labor markets as a tool for behavioral
              experimentation. I review numerous replication studies indicating
              that AMT data is reliable. I also present two new experiments on
              the reliability of self-reported demographics. In the first, I
              use IP address logging to verify AMT subjects' self-reported
              country of residence, and find that 97\% of responses are
              accurate. In the second, I compare the consistency of a range of
              demographic variables reported by the same subjects across two
              different studies, and find between 81\% and 98\% agreement,
              depending on the variable. Finally, I discuss limitations of AMT
              and point out potential pitfalls. I hope this paper will
              encourage evolutionary modelers to enter the world of
              experimentation, and help to strengthen the bond between
              theoretical and empirical analyses of the evolution of human

               measure the hospital costs of treating terminal patients in
               Belgium from the health care payer perspective. Also, this study
               compares the costs of palliative and usual care in different
               types of hospital wards. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective
               cohort study compared costs of palliative care with usual care
               in acute hospital wards and with care in palliative care units.
               The study enrolled terminal patients from a representative
               sample of hospitals. Health care costs included fixed hospital
               costs and charges relating to medical fees, pharmacy and other
               charges. Data sources consisted of hospital accountancy data and
               invoice data. RESULTS: Six hospitals participated in the study,
               generating a total of 146 patients. The findings showed that
               palliative care in a palliative care unit was more expensive
               than palliative care in an acute ward due to higher staffing
               levels in palliative care units. Palliative care in an acute
               ward is cheaper than usual care in an acute ward. CONCLUSIONS:
               This study suggests that palliative care models in acute wards
               need to be supported because such care models appear to be less
               expensive than usual care and because such care models are
               likely to better reflect the needs of terminal patients. This

              require mentalizing. Older and younger human adults were scanned
              using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing
              three different social-cognitive tasks. Across three mentalizing
              paradigms, younger and older adults viewed animated shapes in
              brief social vignettes, stories about a person's moral actions,
              and false belief stories. Consistent with predictions, older
              adults responded less accurately to stories about others' false
              beliefs and made less use of actors' intentions to judge the
              moral permissibility of behavior. These impairments in
              performance during social-cognitive tasks were accompanied by
              age-related decreases across all three paradigms in the BOLD
              response of a single brain region, the dorsomedial prefrontal

              to include representations of others' belief about our
              intentions, their model about our belief about their intentions,
              and so on. We developed a ``stag hunt'' game in which human
              subjects interacted with a computerized agent using different
              degrees of sophistication (recursive inferences) and applied an
              ecologically valid computational model of dynamic belief

              the order in which person information is presented'') orienting
              tasks. Extending previous research on the neural basis of social
              cognition, the impression formation task differentially engaged
              an extensive region of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC).
              In contrast, the nonsocial sequencing task differentially engaged
              the superior frontal and parietal gyri, precentral gyrus, and the
              caudate. In addition, we compared encoding activations for

              from subsequent misses depended on which orienting task was
              performed at encoding: subsequent memory was correlated with

              brain instantiates social and nonsocial cognitive processes.
              Second, by demonstrating that activity in different brain regions
              correlates with subsequent memory as a function of the orienting
              task performed at encoding, these data provide evidence of the
              neural basis for encoding specificity, the principle that memory

              the theoretical and empirical analysis of human memory. Recency
              has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay,
              displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of
              recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955;
              Mensink \& Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in
              terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective
              of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental
              state. This random context view has recently been incorporated
              into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997;
              Murdock, Smith, \& Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative
              model. Rather than being driven by random fluctuations, this
              formulation, the temporal context model (TCM), uses retrieval of
              prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In TCM,
              retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This
              allows the model to provide a principled explanation of the

              this effect and showed that this tendency, which the authors
              refer to as the lag recency effect, is well described by a
              variant of the search of associative memory (SAM) model (J. G. W.
              Raaijmakers \& R. M. Shiffrin, 1980, 1981). In 2 experiments,
              participants performed immediate, delayed, and continuous
              distractor free recall under conditions designed to minimize
              rehearsal. The lag recency effect, previously observed in
              immediate free recall, was also observed in delayed and
              continuous distractor free recall. Although two-store memory
              models, such as SAM, readily account for the end-of-list recency
              effect in immediate free recall, and its attenuation in delayed
              free recall, these models fail to account for the long-term

              the amount of cognitive capacity it required to implement.

              common across a number of neuroscientific subdiscliplines to
              associate activation in the striatum with anticipation of a
              rewarding outcome or a positive emotional state. However, most
              studies have failed to dissociate expected value from the
              motivation associated with seeking a reward. Although motivation
              generally scales positively with increases in potential reward,
              there are circumstances in which this linkage does not apply. The
              current study dissociates value-related activation from that
              induced by motivation alone by employing a task in which
              motivation increased as anticipated reward decreased. This design
              reverses the typical relationship between motivation and reward,
              allowing us to differentially investigate fMRI BOLD responses

              with value and motivation across the striatum. Specifically,
              responses in the caudate and putamen increased with motivation,
              whereas nucleus accumbens activity increased with expected
              reward. Consistent with this, self-report ratings indicated a
              positive association between caudate and putamen activity and
              arousal, whereas activity in the nucleus accumbens was more
              associated with liking. We conclude that there exist regional

               we are communicating with is the core of social intelligence.
               Social intelligence is a facet of human intelligence that has
               been argued to be indispensable and perhaps the most important
               for success in life. This paper argues that next-generation
               computing needs to include the essence of social intelligence --
               the ability to recognize human social signals and social
               behaviours like turn taking, politeness, and disagreement -- in
               order to become more effective and more efficient. Although each
               one of us understands the importance of social signals in
               everyday life situations, and in spite of recent advances in
               machine analysis of relevant behavioural cues like blinks,
               smiles, crossed arms, laughter, and similar, design and
               development of automated systems for social signal processing
               (SSP) are rather difficult. This paper surveys the past efforts
               in solving these problems by a computer, it summarizes the
               relevant findings in social psychology, and it proposes a set of
               recommendations for enabling the development of the next
               generation of socially aware computing.",

              effectiveness of interventions for family caregivers of older
              adults. DESIGN AND METHODS: Meta-analysis was used to synthesize
              the effects of 78 caregiver intervention studies for six outcome
              variables and six types of interventions. RESULTS: The combined
              interventions produced a significant improvement of 0.14 to 0.41
              standard deviation units, on average, for caregiver burden,
              depression, subjective well-being, perceived caregiver
              satisfaction, ability/knowledge, and care receiver symptoms.
              Intervention effects were larger for increasing caregivers'
              ability/knowledge than for caregiver burden and depression.
              Psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic interventions showed the
              most consistent short-term effects on all outcome measures.
              Intervention effects for dementia caregivers were smaller than
              those for other groups. The number of sessions, the setting, care
              receiver age, caregiver age, gender, type of caregiver-care
              receiver relationship (spouse vs adult child), initial burden,
              and study characteristics moderated the observed effects.
              IMPLICATIONS: Caregiver interventions are effective, but some
              interventions have primarily domain-specific effects rather than
              global effects. The differences between intervention types and
              moderators suggest ways of optimizing interventions.",

  abstract = "One crucial test for any quantitative model of the brain is to
              show that the model can be used to accurately decode information
              from evoked brain activity. Several recent neuroimaging studies
              have decoded the structure or semantic content of static visual
              images from human brain activity. Here we present a decoding
              algorithm that makes it possible to decode detailed information
              about the object and action categories present in natural movies
              from human brain activity signals measured by functional MRI.
              Decoding is accomplished using a hierarchical logistic regression
              (HLR) model that is based on labels that were manually assigned
              from the WordNet semantic taxonomy. This model makes it possible
              to simultaneously decode information about both specific and
              general categories, while respecting the relationships between
              them. Our results show that we can decode the presence of many
              object and action categories from averaged blood-oxygen
              level-dependent (BOLD) responses with a high degree of accuracy
              (area under the ROC curve > 0.9). Furthermore, we used this
              framework to test whether semantic relationships defined in the
              WordNet taxonomy are represented the same way in the human brain.
              This analysis showed that hierarchical relationships between
              general categories and atypical examples, such as organism and
              plant, did not seem to be reflected in representations measured

  abstract = "In this research, we examine how cooperation emerges and develops
              in sequential dyadic interactions when the initial interaction
              varies in strategic considerations (i.e., fear of partner
              rejection) or potential gossip by one's partner that may affect
              subsequent interactions. In a lab experiment involving real-time
              interactions (N = 240) across 39 sessions, participants acted in
              different roles (i.e., Person A, B, and C) in two different
              games-Person A was first assigned to allocate an amount of
              resource to Person B in a dictator game or an ultimatum game.
              Afterward, Person C interacted with Person A (i.e., trustee) as a
              trustor in a trust game. Prior to their decisions, participants
              (a) learned that Person B could gossip by sending evaluations
              about Person A's behavior to Person C prior to the trust game or
              (b) did not receive this information. Findings replicate previous
              research showing that potential gossip by one's partner greatly
              increases cooperation that is revealed in the resources allocated
              to the partner. Yet, compared to the dictator game, the presence
              of strategic considerations in the ultimatum game does not
              significantly enhance cooperation, and even makes people less
              likely to reciprocate others' behavior in the subsequent
              interaction. Interestingly, when there is no gossip, those who
              have played the ultimatum game, compared to the dictator game,
              are more trusted by others but do not vary in reciprocity in the
              subsequent interaction. However, when there is gossip, those who
              have played the dictator game, compared to the ultimatum game,
              are more trusted and also more likely to reciprocate others'
              behavior in the subsequent interaction. These findings imply that
              gossip invariably promotes cooperation across strategic and
              non-strategic situations, but the potential rejection by one's
              partner weakly promotes cooperation, and even undermines future
              cooperation especially when paired with reputation sharing
              opportunities. We discuss the implications of these findings for
              implementing reputation systems that can promote and maintain

              enabling non-invasive investigation of brain function and
              connectivity. However, BOLD-based fMRI is a rather indirect
              measure of brain function, confounded by physiology related
              signals, e.g., head or brain motion, brain pulsation, blood flow,
              intermixed with susceptibility differences close or distant to
              the region of neuronal activity. Even though a plethora of
              preprocessing strategies have been published to address these
              confounds, their efficiency is still under discussion. In
              particular, physiological signal fluctuations closely related to
              brain supply may mask BOLD signal changes related to ``true''
              neuronal activation. Here we explore recent technical and
              methodological advancements aimed at disentangling the various
              components, employing fast multiband vs. standard EPI, in
              combination with fast temporal ICA. Our preliminary results
              indicate that fast (TR <0.5 s) scanning may help to identify and
              eliminate physiologic components, increasing tSNR and functional
              contrast. In addition, biological variability can be studied and
              task performance better correlated to other measures. This should
              increase specificity and reliability in fMRI studies.
              Furthermore, physiological signal changes during scanning may
              then be recognized as a source of information rather than a
              nuisance. As we are currently still undersampling the complexity
              of the brain, even at a rather coarse macroscopic level, we
              should be very cautious in the interpretation of neuroscientific
              findings, in particular when comparing different groups (e.g.,
              age, sex, medication, pathology, etc.). From a technical point of
              view our goal should be to sample brain activity at layer
              specific resolution with low TR, covering as much of the brain as
              possible without violating SAR limits. We hope to stimulate
              discussion toward a better understanding and a more quantitative

              neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to
              neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No
              framework for comparative algorithm development and
              dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often
              limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes
              time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address
              computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal
              articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these
              issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and
              Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source,
              community-developed, software package, and scriptable library.
              Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing
              neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by
              facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows.
              Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive
              exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within
              and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of
              algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use
              different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote
              execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional
              scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed,
              allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven
              development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and
              address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community,
              especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible
              research.",

              gossip may promote generosity and cooperation, especially in
              situations that can result in greater indirect benefits from
              others. Drawing on evolutionary theory, we derive novel
              hypotheses about how two reliably recurring properties of human
              social networks -- they are ``small'' and contain fewer
              well-connected people -- provide insight about when people may
              maximize indirect benefits of generosity. Across three studies,
              we find support for the hypothesis that people increase their
              generosity when the recipient (or an observer) is connected and
              can gossip to at least one or many others whom they might
              interact with in the future. Moreover, reputational concern,
              rather than expected indirect benefits from one's future
              partners, primarily mediated this observed gossip-based
              generosity, and the mediation effect of reputational concern was
              statistically more pronounced for proselfs than for prosocials.
              We discuss the importance of these findings in the context of
              evolutionary perspectives on human cooperation, along with some
              novel insights about how properties of social networks influence

              effects compared with the true effect sizes. I discuss here the
              main reasons for this inflation. First, theoretical
              considerations prove that when true discovery is claimed based on
              crossing a threshold of statistical significance and the
              discovery study is underpowered, the observed effects are
              expected to be inflated. This has been demonstrated in various
              fields ranging from early stopped clinical trials to genome-wide
              associations. Second, flexible analyses coupled with selective
              reporting may inflate the published discovered effects. The
              vibration ratio (the ratio of the largest vs. smallest effect on
              the same association approached with different analytic choices)
              can be very large. Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of
              interpretation due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered
              effects are not always inflated, and under some circumstances may
              be deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of
              associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence, in
              some types of misclassification from measurement error, and in
              conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss potential
              approaches to this problem. These include being cautious about
              newly discovered effect sizes, considering some rational
              down-adjustment, using analytical methods that correct for the
              anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude of the effect (if
              not necessary), conducting large studies in the discovery phase,
              using strict protocols for analyses, pursuing complete and
              transparent reporting of all results, placing emphasis on
              replication, and being fair with interpretation of results.",

              more intense in groups remains elusive. Here we examine the novel
              possibility that group attention-the experience of simultaneous
              coattention with one's group members-increases emotional
              intensity relative to attending alone, coattending with
              strangers, or attending nonsimultaneously with one's group
              members. In Study 1, scary advertisements felt scarier under
              group attention. In Study 2, group attention intensified feelings
              of sadness to negative images, and feelings of happiness to
              positive images. In Study 3, group attention during a video
              depicting homelessness led to greater sadness that prompted
              larger donations to charities benefiting the homeless. In Studies
              4 and 5, group attention increased the amount of cognitive
              resources allocated toward sad and amusing videos (as indexed by
              the percentage of thoughts referencing video content), leading to
              more sadness and happiness, respectively. In all, these effects
              could not be explained by differences in physiological arousal,
              emotional contagion, or vicarious emotional experience. Greater
              fear, gloom, and glee can thus result from group attention to

               for simpler models, but this use of ``Occam's razor'' has been
               strongly criticized by several authors (e.g., Schaffer, 1993;
               Webb, 1996). This controversy arises partly because Occam's
               razor has been interpreted in two quite different ways. The
               first interpretation (simplicity is a goal in itself) is
               essentially correct, but is at heart a preference for more
               comprehensible models. The second interpretation (simplicity
               leads to greater accuracy) is much more problematic. A critical
               review of the theoretical arguments for and against it shows
               that it is unfounded as a universal principle, and demonstrably
               false. A review of empirical evidence shows that it also fails
               as a practical heuristic. This article argues that its continued
               use in KDD risks causing significant opportunities to be missed,
               and should therefore be restricted to the comparatively few
               applications where it is appropriate. The article proposes and

              African variation for the measurements employed. It is heavily

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The difficult decision to forgo (withhold or
              withdraw) life-sustaining treatment has received extensive
              commentary. Little attention has been paid to how physicians do,
              and should, care for dying patients once this decision is made.
              This study describes the characteristics of patients who forgo
              treatment, determines the range and sequential process of
              forgoing treatment, and suggests ethical and public policy
              implications. DESIGN: The charts of all patients who died at the
              University of Minnesota Hospital during a 2-month period were
              reviewed. The patient information that was collected included age
              and sex, diagnoses, mental status, location in the hospital
              length of hospital stay, method of payment, the timing of the
              first decision to forgo treatment, and the range and sequence of
              interventions forgone. SETTING: All ICUs and general wards in a
              586-bed tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients
              who died at the University of Minnesota Hospital during May and
              June 1989. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 52 (74\%) of 70 patients who
              died had some intervention withheld or withdrawn before death.
              Those patients in whom treatment was forgone were more likely to
              have an underlying malignancy or impaired mental status and
              longer hospital stays. Thirty-two (62\%) of 52 patients who
              declined some treatment were in an ICU; 26 (50\%) of 52 patients
              required mechanical ventilation. On average, 5.4 separate
              interventions were forgone per patient. Resuscitation and/or
              endotracheal intubation were generally the first measures
              withheld; once a patient required a ventilator, withdrawing the
              ventilator was a late decision. Precise methods of ventilatory
              and vasopressor withdrawal varied considerably among patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: Forgoing life-sustaining treatment is not a single
              decision but it often occurs in a sequential manner over several
              days. A strict analysis of the benefits and burdens of various
              interventions may be inadequate in deciding what interventions
              are appropriate in the care of the dying patient.",

               Gossip is defined as a conversation about a third person who is
               not participating in the conversation. Having analyzed the costs
               and benefits of gossip, we prefer the coalition hypothesis.~It
               states that gossip will flourish in social networks that have a
               relatively large number of coalition triads, that is ego and
               alter having a good relationship amongst themselves and both
               having a bad relationship with tertius, the object of gossip.
               Two rivalling hypotheses are developed. The constraint
               hypothesis predicts that the inclination towards gossip is
               greater, the larger the number of structural holes in the
               personal network of the gossipmonger.~The closure hypothesis
               predicts that more gossip will be found in networks with a large
               number of closed triads, that is where both gossipmonger and
               listener have a good relationship with the absent third person.
               The hypotheses are tested using a newly developed instrument to
               measure gossip behavior and network data from six work
               organizations and six school classes. The data support the

              experimental control have led to persistent concerns about the
              quality of the data that can be obtained from MTurk samples. In
              this paper we focus on two of the most salient concerns---that
              MTurk participants may not buy into interactive experiments and
              that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review
              existing research on these topics and present new data to address
              these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is no more a
              problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly used
              convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that MTurk
              participants buy into interactive experiments and trust
              researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies.
              Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods
              consistently boosts statistical power without introducing
              problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the
              post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution
              for dealing with problematic respondents across samples. We

               We find, in both an analytic derivation and model simulations,

               asymmetries associated with emotion. Many different conceptual
               schemes have also been invoked to guide research on this topic.
               The purpose of this article is to survey the critical
               methodological and conceptual issues in this area of research.
               Research in this area must acknowledge the multi-componential
               nature of emotion. Asymmetries associated with the perception of
               emotional information and the posing of emotional expressions
               are not necessarily the same as those that accompany the actual
               production of emotion. Asymmetries vary along the rostral/caudal
               plane both in their magnitude and direction, as well as in their
               functional significance. Research in this area must explicitly
               take this variable into account. Different measures of asymmetry
               do not reflect the same underlying process and so cannot be used
               interchangeably. In particular, behavioural measures which lack
               extensive localising validation, must be used with caution.
               Finally, the nature of the causal connection between alterations
               in asymmetric activation and emotion is not a simple one and
               extant data indicate that an asymmetric shift is not sufficient
               for the production of emotion. This fact has serious
               implications for the types of experimental designs that must be
               used to adequately test for relations between cerebral asymmetry
               and emotion. The article concludes with a discussion of some of
               the major outstanding questions that will occupy a central

              essentialism and investigate the ways in which essentialism

              Essentialism succeeds in explaining the inferences, I argue,

              connecting category membership and the possession of certain
              characteristic appearances and behavior. This suggests that the
              data will be equally well explained by a non-essentialist
              hypothesis that attributes belief in the appropriate causal laws
              to the child, but makes no claim as to whether or not the child
              represents essences. I provide several reasons to think that this

              inferences? Here, we test 4 major theories of person perception,
              and 1 synthetic theory that combines their features, to determine
              whether the dimensions of such theories can serve as bases for
              describing patterns of neural activity during mentalizing. While
              undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants
              made social judgments about well-known public figures. Patterns
              of brain activity were then predicted using feature encoding
              models that represented target people's positions on theoretical
              dimensions such as warmth and competence. All 5 theories of
              person perception proved highly accurate at reconstructing
              activity patterns, indicating that each could describe the
              informational basis of mentalizing. Cross-validation indicated
              that the theories robustly generalized across both targets and

              for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed.
              This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the

              number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device
              than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that
              there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three
              to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide
              variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller
              capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in
              analyses of information processing only if the boundary
              conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four
              basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity
              limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information
              overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when
              other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of
              stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance
              discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various
              indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions,
              rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus
              items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms
              that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the
              capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall.
              A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is
              implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The

              compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held
              chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall
              within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the

              visualize high-dimensional datasets in a similarly intuitive way.
              Here we present HypeTools, a Python toolbox for visualizing and
              manipulating large, high-dimensional datasets. Our primary
              approach is to use dimensionality reduction techniques (Pearson,
              1901; Tipping \& Bishop, 1999) to embed high-dimensional datasets
              in a lower-dimensional space, and plot the data using a simple
              (yet powerful) API with many options for data manipulation [e.g.
              hyperalignment (Haxby et al., 2011), clustering, normalizing,
              etc.] and plot styling. The toolbox is designed around the notion
              of data trajectories and point clouds. Just as the position of an
              object moving through space can be visualized as a 3D trajectory,
              HyperTools uses dimensionality reduction algorithms to create
              similar 2D and 3D trajectories for time series of
              high-dimensional observations. The trajectories may be plotted as
              interactive static plots or visualized as animations. These same
              dimensionality reduction and alignment algorithms can also reveal
              structure in static datasets (e.g. collections of observations or

  abstract = "Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of
              parameters to achieve good performance. One may intuitively use
              the number of parameters required as a rough gauge of the
              difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are such notions? How
              many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt to
              answer this question by training networks not in their native
              parameter space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented
              subspace. We slowly increase the dimension of this subspace, note
              at which dimension solutions first appear, and define this to be
              the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The approach
              is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces
              several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller
              intrinsic dimensions than one might suspect, and the intrinsic
              dimension for a given dataset varies little across a family of
              models with vastly different sizes. This latter result has the
              profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough
              to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase
              the dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension
              allows some quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across
              supervised, reinforcement, and other types of learning where we
              conclude, for example, that solving the inverted pendulum problem
              is 100 times easier than classifying digits from MNIST, and
              playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying
              CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the
              objective landscapes wandered by parameterized models, the method
              is a simple technique for constructively obtaining an upper bound
              on the minimum description length of a solution. A byproduct of
              this construction is a simple approach for compressing networks,
              in some cases by more than 100 times.",

              highly desirable at test time, training very deep networks comes
              with its own set of challenges. The gradients can vanish, the
              forward flow often diminishes, and the training time can be
              painfully slow. To address these problems, we propose stochastic
              depth, a training procedure that enables the seemingly

              significantly on almost all data sets that we used for

              comparisons of girls' stereotypes about activities and their
              preferences for activities were conducted, for both girls who
              claimed to be tomboys and those who did not. Congruence was
              expected for all girls, but because of their gender non-normative
              interests, tomboys may exhibit less congruence. A secondary goal
              was to examine factors that might influence congruence,
              specifically, whether tomboys develop more inclusive stereotypes
              and develop greater understanding of stereotype variability.
              Participants included 112 girls (7-12 years old, M age=9). Girls
              were interviewed about their activity preferences, beliefs about
              girls' and boys' activity preferences, understanding variability
              of stereotypes, and identification as tomboys. Tomboys (30\% of
              the sample) and non-tomboys did not differ in their liking of or
              in the number of liked feminine activities. However, tomboys
              showed more interest in masculine activities than non-tomboys.
              Tomboys and non-tomboys did not differ in stereotype
              inclusiveness, although tomboys showed a trend toward more

              efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that
              ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves
              effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions
              imply greater errors than do ``rational'' decisions as defined by
              logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the
              assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an
              empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive
              heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the

              accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for

              death is surprisingly lacking. The purpose of this study was to
              gather descriptions of the components of a good death from
              patients, families, and providers through focus group discussions
              and in-depth interviews. Seventy-five participants-including
              physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, hospice
              volunteers, patients, and recently bereaved family members-were
              recruited from a university medical center, a Veterans Affairs
              medical center, and a community hospice. Participants identified
              six major components of a good death: pain and symptom
              management, clear decision making, preparation for death,
              completion, contributing to others, and affirmation of the whole
              person. The six themes are process-oriented attributes of a good
              death, and each has biomedical, psychological, social, and
              spiritual components. Physicians' discussions of a good death
              differed greatly from those of other groups. Physicians offered
              the most biomedical perspective, and patients, families, and
              other health care professionals defined a broad range of
              attributes integral to the quality of dying. Although there is no
              ``right'' way to die, these six themes may be used as a framework
              for understanding what participants tend to value at the end of
              life. Biomedical care is critical, but it is only a point of
              departure toward total end-of-life care. For patients and
              families, psychosocial and spiritual issues are as important as
              physiologic concerns.",

              have recently undergone two major shifts. The first shift is from
              the assumption that concepts have defining properties (the

              based on properties that are only characteristic or typical of

              probabilistic view and the classical view assume that
              categorization is driven by similarity relations. A major problem
              with describing category structure in terms of similarity is that
              the notion of similarity is too unconstrained to give an account
              of conceptual coherence. The second major shift is from the idea
              that concepts are organized by similarity to the idea that
              concepts are organized around theories. In this article, the

              these recommendations, and to examine how conflicts over these
              recommendations are resolved. In 1992 and 1993 we prospectively
              enrolled 179 consecutive patients from two intensive care units
              (ICUs) for whom a recommendation was made to withhold or withdraw
              life support. Where possible, we compared results with data
              collected in the same units over a similar time period in 1987
              and 1988. Recommendations to withhold or withdraw life support
              preceded 179 of 200 deaths (90\%) in 1992 and 1993, compared with
              114 of 224 deaths (51\%) in 1987 and 1988 (chi2 = 73.76, p <
              0.001]. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated in 10\% of

              Ninety percent of patients agreed within less than 5 d, and only
              eight patients (4\%) refused physicians' recommendations to limit
              life support. In cases of conflict, physicians in 1992 and 1993
              deferred to patients with one exception: physicians were willing
              to refuse surrogate requests for resuscitation of patients they
              considered hopelessly ill. We conclude that 90\% of patients who
              die in these ICUs now do so following a decision to limit
              therapy, that this represents a major change in practice in these
              institutions over a period of 5 yr, that most patients and
              surrogates accept an appropriate recommendation to withhold or

              program with significant clinical exposure to critical care
              medicine, asking them prospectively to classify patients who died
              into one of five mutually exclusive categories. We received data
              from 131 ICUs at 110 institutions in 38 states. There were 6,303
              deaths, of which 393 patients were brain dead. Of the remaining
              5,910 patients who died, 1,544 (23\%) received full ICU care
              including failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); 1,430
              (22\%) received full ICU care without CPR; 797 (10\%) had life
              support withheld; and 2,139 (38\%) had life support withdrawn.
              There was wide variation in practice among ICUs, with ranges of 4

              contempt, envy, and pity. From these intergroup emotions and
              stereotypes, the behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes
              (BIAS) map predicts distinct behaviors: active and passive,
              facilitative and harmful. After defining warmth/communion and
              competence/agency, the chapter integrates converging work
              documenting the centrality of these dimensions in interpersonal
              as well as intergroup perception. Structural origins of warmth
              and competence perceptions result from competitors judged as not
              warm, and allies judged as warm; high status confers competence
              and low status incompetence. Warmth and competence judgments
              support systematic patterns of cognitive, emotional, and
              behavioral reactions, including ambivalent prejudices. Past views
              of prejudice as a univalent antipathy have obscured the unique
              responses toward groups stereotyped as competent but not warm or
              warm but not competent. Finally, the chapter addresses unresolved
              issues and future research directions.",

               in a laboratory study of managerial decision making using
               multiple, convergent measures of mood, individual attitudes,
               behavior, and group-level dynamics. Using a 2 times 2
               experimental design, with a trained confederate enacting mood
               conditions, the predicted effect of emotional contagion was
               found among group members, using both outside coders' ratings of
               participants' mood and participants' self-reported mood. No
               hypothesized differences in contagion effects due to the degree
               of pleasantness of the mood expressed and the energy level with
               which it was conveyed were found. There was a significant
               influence of emotional contagion on individual-level attitudes
               and group processes. As predicted, the positive emotional
               contagion group members experienced improved cooperation,
               decreased conflict, and increased perceived task performance.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: To shed light on the values and considerations that
              affect the decision-making processes and the decisions to limit
              intensive care treatment. METHOD: Qualitative methodology with
              participant observation and in-depth interviews, with an emphasis
              on eliciting the underlying rationale of the clinicians' actions
              and choices when limiting treatment. RESULTS: Informants
              perceived over-treatment in intensive care medicine as a dilemma.
              One explanation was that the decision-making base was somewhat
              uncertain, complex and difficult. The informants claimed that
              those responsible for taking decisions from the admitting ward
              prolonged futile treatment because they may bear guilt or
              responsibility for something that had gone wrong during the
              course of treatment. The assessments of the patient's situation
              made by physicians from the admitting ward were often more
              organ-oriented and the expectations were less realistic than
              those of clinicians in the intensive care unit who frequently had
              a more balanced and overall perspective. Aspects such as the
              personality and the speciality of those involved, the culture of
              the unit and the degree of interdisciplinary cooperation were
              important issues in the decision-making processes. CONCLUSION:
              Under-communicated considerations jeopardise the principle of
              equal treatment. If intensive care patients are to be ensured
              equal treatment, strategies for interdisciplinary, transparent
              and appropriate decision-making processes must be developed in
              which open and hidden values are rendered visible, power
              structures disclosed, employees respected and the various
              perspectives of the treatment given their legitimate place.",
